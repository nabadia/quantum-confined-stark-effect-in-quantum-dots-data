abstract = {The quantum-confined Stark effect in InAs/In(Ga)As quantum dots (QDs) using non-intentionally doped and p-doped QD barriers was investigated to compare their performance for use in optical modulators. The measurements indicate that the doped QD barriers lead to a better figure of merit (FoM), defined as the ratio of the change in absorption \&\#x0394;\&\#x03B1; for a reverse bias voltage swing to the loss at 1 V \&\#x03B1;(1 V), FoM\&\#x003D;\&\#x0394;\&\#x03B1;/\&\#x03B1; (1 V). The improved performance is due to the absence of the ground-state absorption peak and an additional component to the Stark shift. Measurements indicate that p-doping the QD barriers can lead to more than a 3x increase in FoM modulator performance between temperatures of \&\#x2212;73 \&\#x00B0;C to 100 \&\#x00B0;C when compared with the stack with NIDQD barriers.},
