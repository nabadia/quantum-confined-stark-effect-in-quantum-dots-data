## Data Description

The folder Data contains the RAW research data described in the paper titled "Measurement of the quantum-confined Stark effect in InAs/In(Ga)As quantum dots with p-doped quantum dot barriers." The paper is in the file oe-30-11-17730.pdf. The Python scripts plot Figures 2, 3 and 5 using the data stored in this repository.

## Usage

There are many Python files to plot the figures in the paper.
- **Fig_2_loss:** This code plots the absorption (α) and change in absorption (Δα) for a 9V-swing at different temperatures of the doped and non-intentionally-doped stacks.
- **Fig_3_peak_and_shift:** This code plots the peak absorption of the quantum-confined Stark effect vs. voltage for different temperatures and the wavelength of the peak absorption vs. voltage.
- **Fig_5a_FoM_5V:** This code plots the Figure of Merit (FoM) vs. wavelength (λ) for a 5V-swing at different temperatures of the doped and non-intentionally-doped stacks.
- **Fig_5b_FoM_10V:** This code plots the Figure of Merit (FoM) vs. wavelength (λ) for a 9V-swing at different temperatures of the doped and non-intentionally-doped stacks.
